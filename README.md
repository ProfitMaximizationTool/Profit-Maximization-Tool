# How to run this build

Note that this project was all created and tested on Windows 10 machines for now

## Pre-requisites

Install virtual env on your computer using the command below:

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```

## Setting up a virtual environment

Run the command below to create a virtual environment with python 3.10 installed

```bash
py -3.10 -m venv sample-venv
```

A folder will be created with the name *sample-venv*. Go inside sample-venv using the command below:

```bash
cd sample-venv
```

Now that you are inside *sample-venv*, to activate the virtual environment, run the command below:

```bash
Scripts\activate.bat
```

You will see that there is a *(sample-venv)* on the left side of your command prompt. It looks like this:

```bash
(sample-venv) C:\...\sample-venv
```

Now that you are inside the virutal environment, you must first install the dependencies of the project.

You can download the text file named *requirements.txt* from the assets dropdown on the project's releases and place it inside the *sample-venv* folder or you can create a text file named *requirements.txt* inside the *sample-venv* folder. Open the said text file using any text editor app and paste the lines below and save the file.

```
asgiref==3.5.0
Django==4.0.2
numpy==1.22.2
Pillow==9.1.0
scipy==1.8.0
sqlparse==0.4.2
tzdata==2021.5
```

Then, install these dependencies using the command below (assuming you are inside the *sample-venv* folder and the virtual environment is activated)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you want to deactivate the virtual environment, just run the command below:

```bash
Scripts\deactivate.bat
```

## Building the project

Note that you can obtain the project's files either by cloning the repo or by downloading the zip file named *Profit-Maximization-Tool-main-v1.zip* from the assets dropdown from Git release.

### Downloading the zip file from Git releases

Download the zip file named *Profit-Maximization-Tool-main-v1.zip* from the releases section of the project's repo. After downloading, extract the contents of the file inside the *sample-venv* folder. You should now be seeing a folder named *profitify*. If it is not named *profitify*, and it is named *Profit-Maximization-Tool-main*, just rename it to *profitify* for ease of navigation using the *cd* command.

### Cloning the project from the repository

Note that you must clone the repository inside the *sample-venv* folder.

```bash
cd sample-venv
```

Make sure that you are inside the *sample-venv* folder before proceeding to clone the repository.

The link to the project's repository is this: [ProfitMaximizationTool/Profit-Maximization-Tool (github.com)](https://github.com/ProfitMaximizationTool/Profit-Maximization-Tool)

In order to clone this git repo to your machine, run the command below:

```git
git clone https://github.com/ProfitMaximizationTool/Profit-Maximization-Tool.git profitify
```

A folder with the name profitify will be created. Inside it are the contents of the repository.

Activate the virtual environment first using the command below (Assuming you are inside *sample-venv* folder).

```bash
Scripts\activate.bat
```

## Running the web application

At this step, it i is assumed that you have already activated the virtual environment and you are inside the *sample-venv* folder. You must see this below in your command prompt:

```bash
(sample-venv) C:\...\sample-venv
```

Next, we need to start the development server using the commands below:

```bash
python profitify\ProfitMaximizationTool\manage.py migrate
```

```bash
python profitify\ProfitMaximizationTool\manage.py runserver
```

You will see in your a line saying

```bash
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

Paste the url into your browser and then you should be seeing the home page of the application now

## Importing files order

1. inventory
2. products
3. production
4. sales
